                    businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using
                    the term “official” is
                    just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products
                    or websites are not
                    licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of
                    its merchandise. In
                    some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is
                    not true in New
                    Orleans.

                    the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday),
                    however, is on a different day each year.

                    Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat
                    Tuesday is always the
                    day before Ash Wednesday.

                    Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash
                    Wednesday. Check
                    out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years

                    morning may turn into a
                    warm afternoon.

                    Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                    somewhat dirty. Don’t

                <div class="accordion-body">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
                    celebration. Those of us who grew up in New
                    Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every parade because we
                    used to use "taking
                    the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they
                    will catch. Throws
                    often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                    The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                    anyway). We recommend
                    seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can last until
                    11 p.m. near the end
                    of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will see many
                    families staking out
                    their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak
                    trees. You don't
                    have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                    You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like Metairie, which
                    is only 10 minutes
                    away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend, is the
                    parade Disneyworld
                    features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                <div class="accordion-body">The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday
                    (generally the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s
                    Day in March).

                    The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their inner-city
                    neighborhoods. Some
                    sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner of LaSalle and 2nd Streets
                    sometime between 9
                    a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and
                    Orleans following
                    the Zulu parade.

                    The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of
                    March, around St.
                    Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at Washington & LaSalle Streets)
                    where the Mardi Gras
                    Indians once again dress in their feathers and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                    Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold their "Super Sunday" parade on the
                    Sunday closest to St.
                    Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years, there has been yet a
                    third Super Sunday
                    called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open weekend between French Quarter Festival and
                    Jazz Fest. No specific
                    details are available on these events at this time

                    some of their throws, and their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect this theme.
                    For example, after
                    9/11, patriotic themes were popular.

                    Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some are
                    named after the

                    the most intricate, massive, and extravagant
                    floats.

                    According to Wikipedia, “While there is no official definition for "super Krewe,” it is generally
                    accepted that a super
                    krewe possesses over 1,000 active dues-paying members and maintains at least 500 riders for its
                    parade each carnival.”
                    Here at MardiGrasNewOrleans.com, we think there’s a little more to it than that.

                    Along with a large membership, super krewes have huge, double- and triple-decker floats, much
                    sought-after signature
                    throws, and celebrity monarchs. They also are known for their big before and after-parade
                    celebrations with big-name
                    talent (i.e., the Bacchus Bash, the Endymion Extravaganza, and the Orpheuscapade).

                    The first super krewe was Bacchus, founded in 1968. While founded in 1967, Endymion emerged as a
                    super krewe in 1974.
                    Orpheus, founded in 1993, also enjoys super krewe status. Three all-female super krewes also take to
                    the parade route,
                    including the Krewe of Muses and the Krewe of Nyx. With 1,600+ active riders, the Krewe of Iris,
                    established in 1917, is
                    not only the largest female Mardi Gras krewe, but it is also the oldest.
