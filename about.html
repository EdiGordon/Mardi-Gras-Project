            <h1 style="text-align:center; color: #8cBF3F;">Mardi Gras History</h1>
            <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th
                and 18th
                centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or
                fatted calf,
                followed France to her colonies.
                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot
                of ground 60
                miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was
                the eve of the
                festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702.
                In 1703, the
                tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.

                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                current Mardi Gras
                krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded from 1711 through
                1861. The
                procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade
                with an actual
                bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.</p>
            <h4>Mardi Gras in New Orleans</h4>
            <p>New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
                Orleans, but not
                with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
                established elegant
                society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.

                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                governing body. That
                year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of clubs and
                carnival organizations
                formed in New Orleans.

                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback riders to
                celebrate Mardi
                Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and lent each event
                an exciting air
                of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking
                John Milton's
                hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling
                floats (known
                as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.</p>
            <h5>Mardi Gras "throws"</h5>
            <p>In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first
                recorded account of
                Mardi Gras "throws."

                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                lithographs of
                parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were always carefully
                guarded before
                the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be clearly seen. But
                beginning in 1886
                with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be produced in full,
                saturated color,
                doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom.
                Each of these
                designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40
                years was
                responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.

                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                first daytime
                parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced Romanoff's
                family colors of
                purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power; and
                green for faith.
                This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was
                cemented, due in
                part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.

                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France,
                culminating with Comus'
                magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache' animal
                costumes served as
                the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor Henry Warmoth.
                In 1875,
                Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in Louisiana, which it
                still is.

                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private social
                clubs with
                restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely funded by their
                members, New
                Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>

                            The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also
                            called Twelfth Night or
                            Kingsâ€™ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.

                            Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our
                            private Carnival clubs,
                            called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers.
                            Visitors quickly learn to
                            say, "Throw me something mister!"

                            The culmination of Mardi Gras in New Orleans begins early on Mardi Gras Day when the Zulu
                            Social

                            the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the
                            fun-filled day of excitement
                            for revelers of all ages.

                            New Orleans, with its unmatched culture and world-famous music and cuisine, is an exciting
                            place
                            to be at any time of
                            the year. We invite everyone to experience Mardi Gras at least once in their lifetime. Make
